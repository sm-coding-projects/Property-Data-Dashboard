# Purpose Filter Logic Fix

## Problem
After implementing the purpose filter, users couldn't see any properties when selecting suburbs. The issue was that the purpose filter was incorrectly treating an empty purposes array as "show zero results" instead of "show all results".

## Root Cause
The purpose filter was implemented with the same logic as the suburb filter:

```python
# INCORRECT LOGIC
if filters.get('purposes') is not None:
    if len(filters['purposes']) > 0:
        # Apply purpose filter
    else:
        # Empty purposes array means no purposes selected, return empty result
        filtered_df = filtered_df.iloc[0:0]  # This was wrong!
```

This caused the following behavior:
- When user uploads data: `purposes` array is empty `[]`
- Purpose filter logic: "Empty array = show zero results"
- Result: No properties shown regardless of other filters

## Solution
Changed the purpose filter to only apply when purposes are actively selected:

```python
# CORRECT LOGIC
if filters.get('purposes') and len(filters['purposes']) > 0:
    # Only apply purpose filter when user has actively selected purposes
    valid_purposes = [p for p in filters['purposes'] if p in df['Primary purpose'].values]
    if valid_purposes:
        filtered_df = filtered_df[filtered_df['Primary purpose'].isin(valid_purposes)]
    else:
        # No valid purposes selected, return empty result
        filtered_df = filtered_df.iloc[0:0]
```

## Filter Logic Comparison

### Suburb Filter (Explicit Selection Required)
- **Empty array**: Show zero results (user explicitly deselected all suburbs)
- **Non-empty array**: Filter by selected suburbs
- **Logic**: `if filters.get('suburbs') is not None:`

### Purpose Filter (Optional Selection)
- **Empty array**: Show all results (user hasn't made any purpose selection)
- **Non-empty array**: Filter by selected purposes  
- **Logic**: `if filters.get('purposes') and len(filters['purposes']) > 0:`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Fresh Upload (No Purpose Selection)
- Purposes array: `[]` (empty)
- Purpose filter: Not applied (shows all purposes)
- Suburb filter: Works normally
- Result: ✅ Properties visible when selecting suburbs

### Scenario 2: Active Purpose Selection
- Purposes array: `["Residential", "Commercial"]`
- Purpose filter: Applied (shows only selected purposes)
- Suburb filter: Works normally
- Result: ✅ Properties filtered by both suburb and purpose

### Scenario 3: Purpose Deselection
- User selects purposes, then deselects all
- Purposes array: `[]` (empty)
- Purpose filter: Not applied (shows all purposes)
- Result: ✅ Back to showing all purposes

## Files Modified
- `Property-Data-Dashboard/app.py` - Fixed purpose filter logic in both `/api/data` and `/api/export` endpoints

## Deployment
Fixed by restarting the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose restart web
```

The application is now working correctly at http://localhost:8080/

## Testing
Users can now:
1. Upload CSV data
2. Select suburbs - ✅ Properties will be visible
3. Optionally select purposes to further filter results
4. Deselect all purposes to return to showing all purposes
5. Use all filters in combination without issues
